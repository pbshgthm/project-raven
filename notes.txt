NARRATIVE
	track the journey of one kid. 
	and as you proceed tell the story of the whole situation

INDUSTRY VIZ
	try sankey/sunburst for industry
		but sankey, it just helps in grouping
		sunburst can be interactive
		make sankey interactive? like collapse things? <- seems promising
		while presenting show examples ?



META OF DATA
