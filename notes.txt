frame rate drops when all alements are drawn at once
draw them sequentially, or lazy load maybe ?


map.setPaintProperty('circle-layer','circle-stroke-color','green')

NARRATIVE
	track the journey of one kid. 
	and as you proceed tell the story of the whole situation

INDUSTRY VIZ
	try sankey/sunburst for industry
		but sankey, it just helps in grouping
		sunburst can be interactive
		make sankey interactive? like collapse things? <- seems promising
		while presenting show examples ?



META OF DATA
	*only half (5979) of the items have proper dates



396 tasks

SEE IF LOG SCALES ARE COOL

THINK ABOUT CREATING BINS FOR WAGES/INC/PAYPAR INSTEAD OF CONTINUOUS 
	CONTI HAS TOO MANY DATA POINTS

//COMBINE PARAMT AND PAYPAR
//CHANGE SIB PLOT => not easy to read, doesnt fit the context

#CHARTLIST

//+ Number of bro/sis and order of birth
//+ relatives working there -> as number
//+ mom/dad working and live status ? occupation req ? \\NOT NEEDED
	less than 8% so needed ? 
//+ child wage
+ co-workers inclusing other kids
	not much of insights
//+ reason of working + consent
//* working start age/if worked before
//* worked before location vs curr location dist ??
+ schooling status, last class, reason
//+ promises to get the child
//+ family incomme
//+ child wish
